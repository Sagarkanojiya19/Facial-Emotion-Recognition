# Expression AI 🎭  
Facial Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning (CNN)  

## 📌 Overview  
**Expression AI** is a deep learning project that recognizes human facial emotions from images.  
Built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**, the model classifies emotions into seven categories:  

- 😠 Angry  
- 🤢 Disgust  
- 😨 Fear  
- 😀 Happy  
- 😐 Neutral  
- 😢 Sad  
- 😲 Surprise  

The model achieves an accuracy of **~70%** and is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** with a user-friendly **Gradio interface** for real-time interaction.
